In this lab, you will implement an app that you can be used to determine the tip based on the service received and to the
total bill. Your app, should have labels indicating what is being displayed in a textbox. For example, the user should be
able to enter the Bill into the app (their should be a label indicating what the textbox’s purpose is), and their should be
additional displays for the calculated tip, as well as, the Total (Bill + Tip). In addition, the user should be afforded
Buttons to select Poor, Good, and Excellent service that influences the tip accordingly:
• Poor – would receive 5% of the Bill as a Tip
• Good – would receive 10% of the Bill as a Tip
• Excellent – would receive 20% of the Bill as a Tip
